#' writeAlizer: An R Package to Generate Automated Writing Quality and Curriculum-Based Measurement (CBM) Scores.
#'
#' Detailed documentation on writeAlizer is available in the \href{https://github.com/shmercer/writeAlizer}{GitHub README file}
#' and \href{https://github.com/shmercer/writeAlizer/wiki}{wiki}
#'
#' The writeAlizer R package (a) imports \href{https://github.com/readerbench/readerbench-java}{ReaderBench},
#' \href{https://soletlab.asu.edu/coh-metrix/}{Coh-Metrix}, and \href{https://www.linguisticanalysistools.org/gamet.html}{GAMET} output files into R,
#' and (b) uses research-developed scoring models to generate predicted writing
#' quality scores or Correct Word Sequences and Correct Minus Incorrect Word Sequences
#' scores from the ReaderBench, Coh-Metrix, and/or GAMET files.
#'
#' The writeAlizer package includes functions to do two types of tasks:
#' (1) importing ReaderBench, Coh-Metrix, and/or GAMET output files into R;
#' and (2) generating predicted quality scores using the imported output files.
#'
#' @section 1. Import output files:
#' \code{\link{import_rb}}
#'
#' \code{\link{import_coh}}
#'
#' \code{\link{import_gamet}}
#'
#' \code{\link{import_merge_gamet_rb}}
#'
#' @section 2. Generate predicted quality scores:
#' \code{\link{predict_quality}}
