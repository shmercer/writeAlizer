# writeAlizer: An R Package to Generate Automated Writing Quality and Curriculum-Based Measurement (CBM) Scores

This repository hosts code for an [R package](https://cran.r-project.org/) to apply research-based writing scoring models (see references below). In addition, this repository hosts documentation as an electronic supplement to published research articles in the repository wiki.

The writeAlizer R package (a) imports [ReaderBench](https://git.readerbench.com/ReaderBench/ReaderBench), [Coh-Metrix](http://cohmetrix.com/), and [GAMET](https://www.linguisticanalysistools.org/gamet.html) output files into R, (b) downloads existing predictive scoring models to the local machine, and (c) uses the predictive scoring models to generate predicted writing quality scores or Correct Word Sequences and Correct Minus Incorrect Word Sequences scores from the ReaderBench, Coh-Metrix, and/or GAMET files.

### Versions
* 1.0.5 (Aug03-2020): Revised ReaderBench file import to allow for input with any length 
* 1.0.4 (July-29-2020): Fixed ReaderBench file import
* 1.0.3 (May-29-2020): Accepts ReaderBench output files as .csv
* 1.0.2 (May-27-2020): predict_quality() also returns an ID variable
* 1.0.1 (May-14-2020): Added model fit objects to package and test data
* 1.0.0 (May-1-2020): Initial Version

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
writeAlizer accepts the following output files as inputs:
 1. ReaderBench: writeAlizer supports output files (.csv format) generated from the standalone version of ReaderBench that is described [here](https://git.readerbench.com/ReaderBench/ReaderBench/-/wikis/how-to/How%20to%20install%20and%20run%20readerbench) and can be downloaded from [here](http://readerbench.com/deployment).
 2. Coh-Metrix: writeAlizer supports output files from Coh-Metrix version 3.0 (.csv format).
 3. GAMET: writeAlizer supports output files from GAMET version 1.0 (.csv format).

The writeAlizer scoring models assume that column names in the output files have been unchanged (exactly the same as generated from the program). For programs that list file paths in the first column, the writeAlizer file import functions will parse the file names from the file paths and store the file names as an identification variable (ID). File names/ID variables need to be numeric.

### Installing

writeAlizer is not available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) due to file size (~500 mb). To install writeAlizer in R, first make sure that the package *devtools* is installed in R
```
install.packages("devtools")
```
With *devtools* installed, you can install writeAlizer in R directly from this Github repository.
```
devtools::install_github("shmercer/writeAlizer")
```
Due to the large file size, it may take a while for writeAlizer to download and install.

## Documentation

Information on the various scoring models available and how they were developed is in this respository's [wiki](https://github.com/shmercer/writeAlizer/wiki):

1. [Description of the general process used to develop scoring algorithms](https://github.com/shmercer/writeAlizer/wiki/Scoring-Model-Development).
2. Description of the following specific scoring models, including information on the relative importance of metrics and weighting of algorithms:
   * [Coh-Metrix Model 1](https://github.com/shmercer/writeAlizer/wiki/CohMetrix-Model-1)
   * [ReaderBench Model 1](https://github.com/shmercer/writeAlizer/wiki/ReaderBench-Model-1)
