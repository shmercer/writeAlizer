Import a ReaderBench output file(.csv) and GAMET output file (.csv) into R, and merge the two files.

\examples{
##Example 1:
#Using a sample data files included with writeAlizer package

#load package
library(writeAlizer)

#get path of sample ReaderBench output file
file_path1 <- system.file("extdata", "sample_rb.csv", package = "writeAlizer")

#see path to sample ReaderBench file
file_path1

#get path of sample GAMET output file
file_path2 <- system.file("extdata", "sample_gamet.csv", package = "writeAlizer")

#see path to sample GAMET file
file_path2

#import files, merge, and store as "rb_gam_file"
rb_gam_file <- import_merge_gamet_rb(file_path1, file_path2)

##Example 2:
#To import as "rb_gam_file" a ReaderBench file (sample name: rb_output.csv)
#and GAMET file (sample name: gamet_output.csv) stored in the working
#directory and then merge them
\dontrun{
rb_gam_file <- import_merge_gamet_rb("rb_output.csv", "gamet_output.csv")
