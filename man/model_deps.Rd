\title{Report optional model dependencies (no installation performed)}
\usage{
model_deps()
}
\value{
A named list:
\describe{
  \item{required}{Character vector of discovered package tokens (may include version qualifiers), e.g. \code{c("glmnet (>= 4.1)", "ranger")}.}
  \item{missing}{Character vector of base package names that are not installed, e.g. \code{c("glmnet", "ranger")}.}
}

The function also emits a message. If nothing is missing, it reports that all
required packages are installed. Otherwise, it lists the missing packages and
prints a copy-paste \code{install.packages()} command.
}
\description{
Discovers package dependencies for model fitting from the package
`Suggests` field. This function **never installs** packages. It reports
which packages are required and which are currently missing, and prints
a ready-to-copy command you can run to install the missing ones manually.
}
\examples{
md <- model_deps()
md$missing
